## :page_facing_up: Explanation
The project is a challenge proposed by the company Innova.

The project is for a website that presents a landing page for the company Holambra that is hosting a big challenge.

You can see the proposed challenges, the event's schedule, the rewards and sign up for the challenge.

The data for the address autocomplete after filling the CEP is from an API called ViaCEP which offers some services for projects like this or even bigger.


## ⚔️ Challenge

In this challenge, you have to Create a Git repository to document the project's development and commit organization, and share it with the responsible party upon completion. Develop an Angular project (version 10 or higher) based on the provided interface layout, ensuring attention to detail and responsiveness for both desktop and mobile views. Divide the page sections into components, and for the form, implement field validation in JavaScript without the need to submit via POST, utilizing the https://viacep.com.br/ API for address fields.
